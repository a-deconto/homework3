<img src="./hw3 PNGS/ED87 EPSG 4321.png" alt="ED87" width="1000" height="666">
</head2> ED 87 seems to be very consistent with its indicatrix points until you get to the north and south poles, where it becomes wildly distorted  

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/IAU 2015_ 39902.png" alt="IAU" width="1000" height="666">
</head3> This projection also distorts and enlarges the poles, and makes the equatorial part seem much smaller than it really is. I don't like this one.           

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/1.TROMELIN 1956 MERCATOR.png" alt="IGNF" width="1000" height="666">
</head4> This looks very outdated, which makes since because it comes from 1956. It also appears even further distorted. 

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/Pseudo Mercator.png" alt="Pseudo Mercator" width="1000" height="666">
</head5> Being a pseudo Mercator, it distorts and enlarges the poles, while making equatorial lands seem much smaller.However, a lot more islands are shown in this projection than others, which is odd. 

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/sphere-compact-miller ESRI_ 53080.png" alt="miller" width="1000" height="666">
</head6> This one also does a better job of showing smaller islands which seem to disapear under more distorted projections. 

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/WGS 84 EPSG_ 4326.png" alt="wgs84" width="1000" height="666">
</head7> It is starting to seem like QGIS only likes allowing mercator-like projections to work. Again, the poles are enlarged and the equatorial lands are shrunk. 

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/world loximuthal esri_ 54030.png" alt="loximuthal" width="1000" height="666">
</head8> This map also does a good job of showcasing islands, and the center 3 rows of dots appear pretty undisturbed. Again, a lot of polar distortion.
