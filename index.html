   <head1>Homework 3 "Projections"  This assignment was difficult for me, as I was convinced QGIS wasn't actually working and refusing to change projections. I used different colors to keep track of changes, despite these issues, to make sure qgis was actually changing each map as I selected a different projection. I think it's interesting that our projections exaggurate the size of Europe and North America, while shrinking the global south. Most of the projections in QGIS seemed pretty similar to the Mercator, which is guilty of this.  </head1>

</head2> ED 87 seems to be very consistent with its indicatrix points until you get to the north and south poles, where it becomes wildly distorted. Shape and area are changed.  </head2> 

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/IAU 2015_ 39902.png" alt="IAU" width="1000" height="666">
</head3> This projection also distorts and enlarges the poles, and makes the equatorial part seem much smaller than it really is. I don't like this one. Both shape and area are distorted at the poles.   </head3>     

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/1.TROMELIN 1956 MERCATOR.png" alt="IGNF" width="1000" height="666">
</head4> This looks very outdated, which makes since because it comes from 1956. It also appears even further distorted. </head4>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/Pseudo Mercator.png" alt="Pseudo Mercator" width="1000" height="666">
</head5> Being a pseudo Mercator, it distorts and enlarges the poles, while making equatorial lands seem much smaller.However, a lot more islands are shown in this projection than others, which is odd. </head5>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/sphere-compact-miller ESRI_ 53080.png" alt="miller" width="1000" height="666">
</head6> This one also does a better job of showing smaller islands which seem to disapear under more distorted projections. Shape and area are distorted. </head6>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/WGS 84 EPSG_ 4326.png" alt="wgs84" width="1000" height="666">
</head7> It is starting to seem like QGIS only likes allowing mercator-like projections to work. Again, the poles are enlarged and the equatorial lands are shrunk. </head7>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/world loximuthal esri_ 54030.png" alt="loximuthal" width="1000" height="666">
</head8> This map also does a good job of showcasing islands, and the center 3 rows of dots appear pretty undisturbed. Again, a lot of polar distortion. 
Both shape and area are changed. </head8>
