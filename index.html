   <head1>Homework 3 "Projections" This assignment was difficult for me at first, as it took a lot of questions to figure out why QGIS wasn't actually changing projections. But, once I got help, it was really easy. I think it is interesting and questionable  that in the MErcator type projections, which seem to be the most popular, it enlarges the size of Europe and North America, while shrinking the global south. I found the eliptical projections to be the easiest to understand, and the ones centered on the poles instead of the equator to be the most confusing. The QGIS lines and dots were very helpful for comparing distortions.Shout out to our TA for putting up with all of my questions :)  </head1> 
   
<img src="./hw3 PNGS/2.loximuthal.png" alt="loximuthal" width="1000" height="666">
</head2> This projection alters shape and size, but size is far less distorted than with mercator projections. I personally find this eliptical shape helpful for visualizing a 3D sphere.  </head2> 

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/3.Miller Cylindrical ESRI_53003.png" alt="miller" width="1000" height="666">
</head3> This projection had far more distortion in shape and size at the poles, while diminishing the size of lands at the equator.  </head3>     

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/4.Robinson ESRI_54030.png" alt="robinson" width="1000" height="666">
</head4>Another eliptical shape, this projection distorts both area and shape, however area is far more consistent accross latitudes. </head4>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/6.Bonne Sphere ESRI_ 53024.png" alt="bonne" width="1000" height="666">
</head5>This visualization suggests a sphere more than any other so far, yet is hard to understand.Distortion in shape and size increase towards the south pole.  </head5>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/7.North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant ESRI_102016.png" alt="NP azimuthal" width="1000" height="666">
</head6> This one is focused on the north pole. Size and area are greatly distorted as one heads south. </head6>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/8.Winkel Tripel ESRI_54042.png" alt="winkel tripel" width="1000" height="666">
</head7> Size seems very well preserved in this eliptical shaped projection, area is slightly distorted (as compared to other projections) </head7>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/9.Pseudo Mercator EPSG_3857.png" alt="pseudo mercator" width="1000" height="666">
</head8> Shape is perfectly portrayed, but size is wildly enlarged at the poles, and shrunk at the equator. </head8>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/1.TROMELIN 1956 MERCATOR.png" alt="tromelin mercator" width="1000" height="666">
</head9>As with all mercator projections, the poles are greatly exaggurated in size, but this one doesnt even preserve shape very well. The south pole is comical. It appears very outdated. </head9>

<img src="./hw3 PNGS/5.World Mercator EPSG_6893.png" alt="World mercator" width="1000" height="666">
</head10> I thought it would be interesting to compare different mercator projections. They all seem bad. Size distortion is too intense for me to like this type of projection.  </head10>
